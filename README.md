# Hotelbooking
Make use of the Restful standard to make a booking with MVC and encapsulation pattern.
I use Mysql and Java 8 with Netbeans 8.0 to develop the Project. 
Takes the user input to make GET request and Bussines Logic check whether or not there is an available room in an hotel given and aynchronous response to the browser.
